## Installation guide

To play WrathWorld you will need a copy of WRATH: Aeon of Ruin. In order to host your own server clone the repository and use fteqcc to compile
the QuakeC source code. Place the mpprogs files into the pak000.pk3 in the kp1 folder in the WRATH install. Launch the wrath-dedicated client and load
the new progs.

## Compiling

### Compiling on Windows

Open ssqc and execute the fteqcc windows executable and compile with default settings.

### Compiling on Linux

Open a terminal in the ssqc directory and run the executable.
```
./fteqcc64
```
